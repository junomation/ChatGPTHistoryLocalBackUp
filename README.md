# ChatGPTHistoryLocalBackUp
This Chrome Extension that saves ChatGPT conversation history.

To load a Chrome extension that you have on your local drive, you would need to enable "developer mode" in the Chrome browser first. Here are the steps:

clone this repostiory ```git clone https://github.com/NapaNova/ChatGPTHistoryLocalBackUp.git```

Open the Chrome browser on your computer.
Go to the Chrome menu by clicking on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser window.
Select "More tools" and then "Extensions".
Turn on "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top-right corner of the page.
Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
Navigate to the file path "path-to-local-repository" where the extension files are located on your local drive.
Select the folder that contains the extension files and click on "Open" button.
The extension should now be loaded and ready to use in the Chrome browser. You can verify that the extension is installed by going to the Extensions page and making sure it's listed.

Additionally, It's important to note that when you load an unpacked extension in developer mode, the browser will not automatically update it like it does with extensions that you installed from the chrome webstore. So if you make any changes to the files, you will have to repeat the steps of loading the unpacked extension.

This process is used by developers to test their extension before publishing it to the chrome webstore.

# ChatGPT聊天记录本地下载

首先下载这个git repo

打开谷歌浏览器
点击浏览器窗口右上角的三个点
选择 "更多工具" 然后 "扩展"
点击页面右上角的开关，打开“开发者模式”
点击 "载入未打包" 按钮
导航到 "这个git repo的本地文件路劲" 文件夹，在那里您本地驱动器上的扩展文件位置
选择包含扩展文件的文件夹，并点击 "开启" 按钮
扩展应该现在已经加载并可以在谷歌浏览器中使用了。您可以通过转到扩展页面并确认它已经列出来验证扩展是否已经安装
重要的是当您在开发者模式下加载未打包扩展时，浏览器不会像从chrome网上商店安装的扩展那样自动更新它。所以如果您对文件进行了任何更改，您需要重新加载未打包扩展。
这个过程被开发人员在发布到chrome网上商店之前用来测试他们的扩展。
